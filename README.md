Game About Squares Solver
=========================

A pretty basic Python3 solver for [http://gameaboutsquares.com](Game About Squares). Right now it's just [brute-force](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Brute-Force) [depth-first](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Search#Search%20Algorithms-Depth-First%20Search) search with [iterative deepening](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Iterative+Deepening), [memoization](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Transposition+Table), [move ordering](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Move+Ordering), and [late-move reductions](http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Late+Move+Reductions) (These references are all from the Chess Programming Wiki, so mentally substitute chess with Game About Squares). The code is more optimized for simplicity/readability than speed.

All 36 levels from the original game (plus 6 others that are defined but not accessible from the game) are included. Thanks to Andrey Shevchuk (the author of GAS) for permission to include them!
