Game About Squares Solver
=========================

A pretty basic Python3 solver for [http://gameaboutsquares.com](Game About Squares). Right now it's just brute-force depth-first search with iterative deepening and memoization. The code is more optimized for simplicity/readability than speed.

All 36 levels from the original game (plus 6 others that are defined but not accessible from the game) are included. Thanks to Andrey Shevchuk (the author of GAS) for permission to include them!

Right now it just tries to solve all of the levels in the order they are defined.
